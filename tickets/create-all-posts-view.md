# Create All Posts View

The root page `/` of your application should display all the posts that exist in the database. You should display each post's title, the amount of comments on that post, and the date/time that the post was created. Ensure that the date is human-readable. Sort the posts by most recent to least recent (try to do the sorting in the database query). Implement pagination so that 10 posts are showing at one time.
