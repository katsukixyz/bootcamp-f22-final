## Comments - Create Comments

Context: Our users really want to leave comments like how much they love Georgia Tech Housing heating during the winter months. They also want others to be able to see their love.

What you need to implement:

- Ability to create a comment that is associated with a post
- Create screen/modal/whatever design you want so that a user can create the comment!
  - This ticket does not concern the actual display of comments under a post, just the process by which you create it
- API endpoint for comment creation

Acceptance Criteria:

- Database should be properly updated when a comment is created (associate the comment to the post it was created on!)
